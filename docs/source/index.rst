Welcome to coffee's documentation!
==================================

coffee (bunna in Amharic) is a light weight python wrapper for the three major frameworks: Caffe, TensorFlow, and Theano.

coffee's major principle is a unifying API without sacrificing transparency to the underlying frameworks. This will make the wrapper lightweight enough to give a unified API without obscuring the powerful tools of the frameworks with the option to directly expose the power of the underlying framework directly.
