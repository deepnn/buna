# Bunna
This is a light weight wrapper for the three major frameworks: Theano, Tensorflow, and caffe.
It is designed to be lightweight, easy to experiment with and modular with a common scikit compatible interface.
The interface makes it easier to convert models back and forth from the underlying frameworks using the converter library.
It is also aims to facilitate interoperability of models trained in one of the frameworks in the others.
